45;Henry T;sound quality, nice place, theater, bec, pvj, mall;40;2015/1/20;-6.94121,107.5925;PRO:Blitzmegaplex has always offered different taste of movies from any other movie franchises in Indo. I had been coming to Blitz Paris Van Java since its opening in the 2000s, I think they had the best lay out and sound quality. But after several years, Blitz PVJ was really bad, especially since 2013. I could see stains on the screen. the picture was blurry, sometimes it was too dark to see. The last movie I watched in PVJ was Dracula the untold story. the quality of the movie show was so bad, I swore not to come back again. what a pity since the movie itself is awesome. I watched it in Cineplex and it was satisfactory .And then another one emerged in a very unexpected place: Kopo (what?)The very location where traffic jam occurs almost every single minute for no reason. The very location where people don't care about movies since 10 years ago (there was a theater here but it died due to the lack of viewers)I watched Dracula again for the third time, for the first 20 minutes, i was totally awkwardly alone inside a theater,very weird, but thankfully a couple came in and save the day.It was an unforgettable experience. The quality of movie show EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATION. I dare say: it was the best movie experience.I have been to many theaters in Malaysia, Bangkok and Singapore, even Hongkong. but the clear picture and sound quality have never been so good like Miko's.Weird.but hopefully it is not an overstatement: it is so good, probably because it is a newbie.At first i was a bit skeptic whether the new born theater would survive the competition, but then they provided a very unique movie called: Doraemon and it was a successful choice. People came there. thousands of them, every day during school holiday this last December.it was a bit silly actually, since the movie itself was not that great. Blitz MIko consists of 7 auditoriums. some are big, and some are smaller. it is new so you can smell new leather coming from all around you. the chairs are comfy and warm. the screen is very wide. the sound system is SUBLIME!!!!Bathroom is not attached inside the theater, so you need to walk a bit to reach it. the staff are at their best, buying ticket is fast. they smile sincerely. although i think they are too skinny.security staff look very young. and probably inexperienced. Although there must have been a mistake since i was mistakenly called 'Sir' since I am not that old (personal feedback, hahaha)They have this amazing spot where you can sit and charge your battery. totally saved my day.After a while, it came back to being a lonely place. hopefully, Blitz would come up with universal movie selections which people would love to watch.PS: come on Tuesdays, incredibly affordable tickets available.

Ended up ordering just a simple fried noodle and when it came it was kinda bland. So requested for some cut chili. Waiter brought a small saucer with maybe chopped 1-2 chili padi. Not much help, the noodle still tasted bland. Anyway when it was time to pay for our meal, shocked to see that we were charged Rp7,000 for the chili!!!! Waiter's reply was like, 'maybe in your country you don't charge but it's different here'.This is the first time ever for us. Have traveled around Indonesia and this is the first time a restaurant charged us for chili. I wouldn't even call this place a restaurant. It's basically just a food court. This is like McDonald's charging me for extra ketchuo. Which was ridiculous.Verdict is to avoid this place all together. Such scammer just to get that Rp7,000 from us just because we are tourist.

We went there on Saturday: the traffic was surprisingly good for weekend, no traffic jam along the way. For weekend, the place was not crowded at all, which is good for us.Since we went with our 1.5 yo child, we brought our stroller. The place was stroller-friendly. There are stairs, but also special path for stroller/wheelchair. The place itself look so old and lack of maintenance. I rode 'futuristic train' which is not futuristic at all. When I rode it, it seems like the train almost break down. It even stopped for a moment and struggled to run again. The train went around a dirty lake. There were no garbage on the water, but I called it dirty since the color of the water was brown.The mini zoo was okay. It looks like a new facility in the village, and looks like still in the process of development. The delman is old. Since the place seems untreated, there is no good scenery to look for when riding the delman, which is unfortunate. But, you could still enjoy the fresh air. It seems no good food there, so we decided to have lunch somewhere else. Not recommended place to visit.

Kota Baru management only upgraded the outside looks to make it 'look' good, but nothing has been done in the inside to actually improve its facilities.They claim that this Sundial is the largest in Asia Pacific, but I highly doubt that information, since that is based upon when Kota Baru Parahyangan first opened in 2002.Overall, not a place to visit.

Then we came across indonesia's classic murtabak manis which is a local dessert pancake packed with a choice of chocolate, peanut, cheese and any other ingredients. However, be warned that it only comes in one size which is approximately like a 10' pizza (50k). You will need a party to finish it up. Refer to our photos to the stalls we had tried.Perpendicular to this street it is Sudirman Street. It is yet another food street but it feels more touristy.

80;Raymond W;;40;208/10/16;-6.91989,107.61071;Bandung has an outstanding collection of art-deco buildings from the 1920's and 1930's. A walking tour of the main structures may well prove to be the highlight of a trip to this city. For the fan of modern architecture the former Denis Bank Building is one of the city's must-see structures.The building was designed by renowned Dutch arcitect, Albert Aalbers. It was originally intended as the office for the Dutch Indies Saving Bank but today it houses the local Bank Jabar (West Java Bank). The building is situated on the corner of Jalan Braga and Jalan Naripan. Its bold curves wrap themselves around the corner of these streets on six different levels. In the middle, a large tower rises vertically above the structure, creating a dramatic break in the 'ocean wave' curve of the structure. This thoroughly modern structure is built from steel with concrete floors. Indeed it is so modern in appearance that it would be easy to believe it was a recent construction with some 'art-deco' touches added. In 1936 it was a cutting edge design and it established Aalbers' as an important and innovative architect. As most travellers to Bandung will visit the historic Jalan Braga at some point, it is easy to take in this sight on a stroll through the inner city.;20934288;Art-Deco Grandeur - Denis Bank Building;40;Architectural Buildings, Sights & Landmarks ;Chengdu, China;13;30.572815;104.066801

80;The_Pale_Ridah;;40;2013/4/23;-6.91989,107.61071;The former DENIS Bank building is a displaced anomaly, a futuristic building transported back in time via dimensional rip to colonial Indonesia where it has remained relatively unknown by the wider world community. To put it in context, in 1930 most of the town had stone colonial buildings for government agencies, wooden huts for local dwellings & dirt roads surrounded by farmland. This strange sleek out-of-place design with curved edges was like a fish-out-water in the 30's or anywhere else in the world, let alone in the middle of the jungle. The visual design has strong biomorphic elements of an ocean wave via curved corners, smooth outlines & its non symmetrical shape. The curves & outlines have an obvious resemblance to modern office building design yet it took the world 80 years to catch up & for its age, it is still has more appeal than many modern buildings around. Described as Expressionist Architecture from the European movement of the early 20th century, the DENIS Bank building is virtually a living piece of artwork which forms part of the city���s cultural architectural heritage. No other city in Asia can claim to have such an impressive collection of Art-Deco buildings which makes Bandung a special destination for fans of architecture. Part of an amazing Dutch Art-Deco heritage, the former DENIS Bank building is in the middle of town on Braga street surrounded by cafes, restaurant���s & local art galleries. Not until we had actually walked past it on the street in Bandung that it occurred to us how brilliant the skill of Albert Aalbers was. Today occupied by the Jaber Bank, it makes for interesting viewing if seen from close up. Another of Aalbers���s creations with similar characteristics is the Savoy Homann Hotel on Asia-Afrika Street.;158629975;Back to the future... - Denis Bank Building;40;Architectural Buildings, Sights & Landmarks ;Gladesville, Australia;13;-33.82961;151.125756

I did not even manage to cover the whole place, but it had a second level for men upstairs. 5. For women: kurti tops, long dresses, batik tops etc. I personally did not find anything much here for myself. Did more shopping for my brother (Fred Perry polo shirts that ranged from SGD 5.90 to SGD19.90) and dad! I mostly got perfume (Marc Jacobs, J.Lo, Escada) where prices ranged from SGD 3.70 to SGD 6.90. Sales girl said that these were original scent but just that they don't last as long. The scents that I purchased were the same as the original ones I got from Singapore. Good selection of Victoria Secrets' lingerie (think SGD19.90/set) :D Eyes glowww!! 6. There is a counter where you can exchange a token and placing your day's shopping at their counters. Free up the tension you have with wanting to keep an eye on them (all at your own risk of course). 7.

I'm not too sure of their opening hours though as they are not fixed shops.

92;yennimd;;50;2016/1/2;-6.957674,107.62281;Just found out about this place from my family, and we visited this water park today! It's absolutely lots of fun! They have several small slides great for little kids, and bigger slides great for kids to teenagers, and if adults want to try, still can try the biggest one! The price to enter this park is only Rp 50.000 per person. I can say that this is an amazing economical price for a water park! To rent a tube it's Rp 25.000 per 2 hours with Rp 25.000 deposit, and to rent a sliding board it's Rp 15.000 per 2 hours with Rp 15.000 deposit. We can also rent a gazebo on the side for only Rp 50.000,- for 2 hours, deposit only Rp 25.000,- I really feel that it's such an amazing deal. Also, it's such a fun park! Although today was extremely full of people, the park is quite well-maintained. It's still clean and very acceptable despite the flow of hundreds of people inside! My boys were having so much fun! We practically spent 4 hours in this park and they still wanted to stay longer. Oh, two small pools are filled with warm/hot water, the other pools are cold water, but it's good because this is located in hot area of Bandung. This location can be accessed from the Batununggal Permai Real Estate complex. I didn't take this route when coming in the morning, and instead took the small route behind the traditional market as I followed waze app's direction. :) Anyhow, I highly recommend this place for a family with small children to teenagers!;336617574;Economical price, great slides... - Panghegar Waterboom;35;Water Parks, Water & Amusement Parks ;Bandung, Indonesia;8;-6.917464;107.619123

71;Daniel P;;30;2015/4/20;-6.829444,107.46861;This is a small lake located in the Western side of Bandung, so it takes around 30-60 minutes from Bandung to reach here. However, I wonder if anyone would really should devote their time into visiting this place, and there are several reasons for that:1. It really has nothing to do. There is an island-sorta restaurant in the middle of the lake, but it costs Rp. 75,000 to hire a boat to take around 2-3 minutes cross to the restaurant. Besides that, there really isn't anything to do.2. There are lot of mosquitoes and other unknown bugs here. This is typical of a water attraction especially when the water is still, so make sure, if you visit this place, you have a good anti-mosquito and anti-ant protection with you. They hurt.Overall, I think this place could have been better for locals and foreigners alike if the local government took better care of it.;266825364;"The true type of ""local"" tourist... - Situ Ciburuy";30;Bodies of Water, Nature & Parks ;Seoul, South Korea;26;37.566535;126.977969

73;RavioPatra;;50;2016/6/6;-6.860163,107.62994;I was privileged to visit Wot Batu a few months before it was open for public while accompanying a group of Singaporean and Indonesian officials in Bandung in October 2015 (they only opened for public in January 2016, I think).This might sound weird, but I actually shed tears while I was in Wot Batu. At first I thought this was just going to be another display of stone statues and all but boy had I never been more wrong. The moment I stepped on the small stones scattered on the entrance, I was already feeling this weird feeling in my tummy. I didn't understand it initially: what was so special about this place? But then I sat down on this big rock (I asked first whether it was okay to sit on it) and started to enjoy the view. A guide explained how the place incorporated elements of fire (the fire that never goes out), water (the small ponds), earth (obviously--it's called the stone garden), and air (it's an open space in Dago Hills, so...of course the air is fresh).I could picture spending hours and hours and hours of my life in Wot Batu simply for its breathtaking view and the profound values the entire garden epitomizes. Sunaryo (the renowned genius sculptor behind the Wot Batu) himself showcased another wonder of Wot Batu: how nature increases your energy. I'm spiritual (yes, spiritual--not religious) so the experience meant a lot to me: the fact that you can actually connect with nature and let it elevate your energy level. I may sound vague, but unless you pay a visit yourself, I guess it'll be hard to understand what is so beautiful about the place.Too bad I think in no time it'll unfortunately be known as the 'best place for selfies' despite its mastermind artful landscape and profound values. But I hope it's just my fear, though.;380433269;Profound in Values - Wot Batu;45;Geologic Formations, Gardens, Nature & Parks ;Bogor, Indonesia;9;-6.597147;106.806039

In other words, I kind of enjoyed both the displayed arts and the guides: so it was a very rewarding visit. So rewarding that I decided to contribute some cash into the contribution box near the exit.I guess when you have quality, you won't have to explicitly ask people for contribution.

The residents there has rural lifestyle: going up very early (around 5AM) then go farming. If you go at daylight, the views are paddy fields. If you go at night, just dark road with lots of citylights of Bandung below you. Before the top of the hill, the road is reaaaly steep and rough.

They provide a spot to burn some woods, small hutts for you to rest your feet, and stone table and seat to enjoy the meal while seeing the landscape.

At the top of the hill, you'll see farming fields and clouds and bandung city -literally- and mountains in the background, just like the painting comes alive!

The rabbits have fur which is silky and almost glowing, and the deer have coats that look glossy. Even the chickens and ducks look healthy and amazing.

In addition you also have the option to shop for many branded tenants who open outlets here. For household shopping options, you can also visit the supermarket which I think is quite large and complete. Not to forget, BIP also features a cinema with many theaters. If you get a chance to watch a movie in theater 1, then you will get a cinema with a big screen which I think is quite satisfactory.Jalan Merdeka where this mall is located is quite crowded. Therefore, to bring a vehicle, it is necessary to avoid the congestion when dropping passengers. But public vehicles are also widely available here such as public minibuses and taxis.

The ticket cost is 200k for adult and 140k for the kid (in Rupiah). If you're a family with two adult and two kids, it's best to buy a family package, saving you another 140k. Prices are for 150 minutes play.Before we go any further, this place is not for the person with no physical strength or acrophobia: you know the one with the phobia of heights.There are several circuits to meet the customer needs, ages, etc. Each circuit marked with different color, let's say yellow circuit is for kids with at least four years old and above. If you're a big guy, don't even think to try it because you'll be stuck on the bamboo platform.If you're an adult, try at least the orange or perhaps the black circuit. One thing I should tell you before trying the black one, feel the fear but do it anyway.Tip: bring your own glove to avoid long queue;514344207;A good place to train your kids - Bandung Treetop;40;Theme Parks, Water & Amusement Parks ;Jakarta;64;-6.17511;106.865039

And many moreConts: for some reason glamping very crowded, lack of access if using local transportation, overpriced for food and ticketing, management and staff not really prepared to control crowd, NOT SUITABLE FOR DISABILITY PEOPLE especially using wheelchair, and for womans be careful of many subtle sexual crimes such as being seducted by local ppl.

We were welcomed by the cool fresh air and we feasted on the beautiful view of the lake of Situ Patenggang and the tea plantations everywhere. The view was amazing. The tent itself was also far from disappointing. It was exactly like what people described. Clean for sure. We stayed in the family tent for 8 persons. It was quite spacious especially if you have small kids. The space in the middle of the tent is spacious enough for you and your family to sit together and do stuffs. However, I have to suggest that you bring a portable stove and rice cooker to cook your meal because the food in the phinisi restaurant quality was not too satisfying. We had lunch which had a so-so taste but the price was just like the restaurants at the mall in Jkt. The breakfast though, was not bad. You will get free breakfast for 8 as well, and thankfully, the breakfast was enjoyable.If you are Indonesians, be prepared to get very cold during the night and in the morning. Get your jacket and sweater ready. Especially, if you visit here during summer (June-August). The temperature can hit as low as 10'C. But dont worry, they do have water heater which makes taking shower a no problem at all.Lastly, I would recommend this place if you want to stay away from the standard stay in the hotel kind of holiday. Glamping is DEFINITELY the right choice. Your children will have so much fun. They get to appreciate the nature and oh, this place has rabbit farm and some other attractions as well. So they won't waste their time doing nothing in the tent. There are lots of stuffs to do here. ;502416591;Camping at its best - Glamping Lakeside Ciwidey;45;Points of Interest & Landmarks, Sights & Landmarks ;Singapore, Singapore;25;1.352083;103.819836

You have to walk a short distance from the car park to the volcano basin and on to the crust -- be aware there are many people about all wanting to sell you surgical masks (they are cheap) so if your going there bring your own as there is a smell of sulphur. The crust is a white covering of some kind of water dust and mud (watch out for your shoes) you would get the impression you were in a huge skating rink but most people seemed like they wanted to walk about on the crust a warning tells you that you should only spend 15 minutes in the basin area.After we had done Kawah Putih we set off for Malabar Tea Plantations its about 20 minutes drive away at crawl speed, On arrival in the area they are a beautiful sight to see loads of hills all covered in tea trees all cut into patterns to allow the workers to collect the tea leaves at the top of the trees (the best tea leaves) we were told. We never went to the actual Tea Resort as it was a distance away and we had to start our return journey back to Bandung. The traffic was just as heavy on the way back so if your thinking of going to see both these 'sights' check first that its not a holiday. Having a local driver and car certainly took a lot of strain out of the trip you can sit back and admire the country side from low level fields full of rice up the Jungle trees and beautiful sights looking down into valleys below talk to other companions and just enjoy the trip even if its only at 10 to 15Km an hour.

While the wife find cloths, pants, bags, shoes etc, husband can find himself cup of coffee at the cafe or foods at the restaurant here, so many good food and drinks : esp for foreigners, you should try traditional foods and drinks such as Batagor, somay Cincau and Cendol etc. And yes, for local like us, the price is too high than other places hihi..

And I wish we didn't rush it, but we didn't want to get rained on while in the park. There are several places of interest in the park, but we only want to go to Curug Omas, one of two waterfalls in the park. The walk was somewhat in the middle. Not too long but not too short. In some areas you have to really hike. Since it rained the night before, the track was sometimes slippery, at times you would run into puddles of water. It's time I think for the park to make the track better. But the weather is nice, the plants are diverse. It's a shame though that the park lets motorcycles drive through it (the drivers would stop and offer you a ride!). We could've enjoyed the walk better. Curug omas (waterfall) was amazing. You could feel the cooler air and even got bits of water on you. Also, such a shame that there was trash at the bottom of the waterfall.

Then when we got it in, we didn't expect how steep it is to get to the very bottom. This is where your cardio, endurance and leg work will be tested.. It's easy going down but going back up, you need to get ready for some serious workout. In the path going down, there are like 3 viewing decks where you can take a sit, rest, enjoy the nature and the monkeys hanging on the trees and just take selfies with your loved ones and friends.
